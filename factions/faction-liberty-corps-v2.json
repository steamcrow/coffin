    "title": "Liberty Corps: Preservation Through Authority",
    "tagline": "Stabilize the park. Enforce the border. Make the canyon compliant.",
    "description": "From the maps of Liberty City, Coffin Canyon is not chaos. It is a Forbidden National Park: a vast, federally claimed preserve set aside for study, stabilization, and eventual development under the authority of the United States of Liberty. Entry without permit is illegal. Resource extraction without oversight is theft. Armed presence without sanction is sedition. That anyone disputes this is… unfortunate. The Liberty Corps exists to resolve that misunderstanding.",
    "philosophy": "The Liberty Corps believes in preservation—and understands that preservation requires decisive action. Unchecked monsters threaten survey teams. Unregulated gangs destabilize claims. Unlicensed mystics interfere with classified research. The canyon cannot be protected if it is allowed to remain wild. Monsters are hazards and unlawful presences; if they can be studied, cataloged, or contained, they will be. If they interfere with infrastructure or personnel, they will be put down. This is not cruelty. It is stewardship. Patriotism is not pageantry—it is procedure.",
    "history": "For decades, Coffin Canyon was quarantined, studied from afar, and written off as too costly to tame. That has changed. Silver veins demand oversight. Thyr demands control. Monsters demand management. The Liberty Corps has been dispatched to secure the park, enforce federal exclusion, and prepare Coffin Canyon for responsible use—checkpoints, forts, railheads, controlled extraction, and where necessary, lethal intervention. Progress does not ask permission."

    "on_monsters": "Monsters are illegal occult foreigners—unregistered entities operating inside a federally restricted National Park without permit, citizenship, or recognized legal standing. Some may be temporarily tolerated for study, containment, or sanctioned use. Most are subject to removal, neutralization, or classified disposition. This is not hatred. This is enforcement. Liberty does not negotiate with unlawful presences. Liberty cleans its borders.",
    "uncle_liberty": "There are contingencies the Corps does not discuss publicly. One of them is Uncle Liberty: the first President of the United States of Liberty, sustained beyond mortality by steam, steel, and duty. Uncle Liberty is not deployed lightly. He is a national response asset. When he appears, it means the situation has escalated beyond local authority, beyond negotiation, beyond patience. Liberty itself has deemed the canyon’s condition unacceptable. And Liberty will be obeyed."
