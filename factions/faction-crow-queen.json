    "tagline": "Order is not debated. It is declared.",
    "description": "Once the absolute ruler of Monstru, the Crow Queen—now called the Regent Black—was deposed by a vulgar monster uprising. Stripped of her throne but not her divinity of will, she fled into exile with her Inner Court. In Coffin Canyon, she has found not refuge, but provocation. Here, she consecrates dust into demesne, collars monsters into obedience, and grinds manlings beneath the heel of remembered sovereignty.",
    "philosophy": "Hierarchy is natural, and the Regent Black stands at its apex by undeniable right. Monsters are instruments, humans are livestock, and land exists only to be named, measured, and ruled. Law is the extension of her shadow.",
    "history": "The fall of Monstru shattered the Crow Court but did not erase it. Loyal servants followed their Queen into the Canyon, carrying relics of authority, ledgers of blood-debt, and rites that bind stone and soil to her command. She does not seek to live in the Canyon; she seeks to own it."
