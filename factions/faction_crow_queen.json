    "title": "The Crow Queen",
    "tagline": "All land bends. All flesh kneels.",
    "description": "Once the absolute ruler of Monstru, the Crow Queen—now called the Regent Black—was deposed by a monster uprising so vulgar it still offends her sense of order. Stripped of her throne but not her divinity of will, she fled with her Inner Court into exile, bearing crowns without kingdoms and laws without land. In Coffin Canyon, she has found not refuge, but provocation. Here, she consecrates dust into demesne, collars monsters into obedience, and grinds manlings beneath the heel of remembered sovereignty. The Canyon does not yet know it kneels—but it will.",
    "philosophy": "Order is not debated. It is declared. Hierarchy is not cruel—it is natural, and the Regent Black stands at its apex by undeniable right. Monsters are instruments, humans are livestock, and land exists only to be named, measured, and ruled.",
    "history": "The fall of Monstru shattered the Crow Court, but it did not erase it. Loyal servants followed their Queen into exile, carrying relics of authority, ledgers of blood-debt, and rites that bind stone and soil to command. Coffin Canyon is not a hiding place—it is a proving ground."
