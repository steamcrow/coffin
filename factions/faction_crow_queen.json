    "tagline": "All land bends. All flesh kneels.",
    "description": "Once the absolute ruler of Monstru, the Crow Queen—now called the Regent Black—was deposed by a monster uprising. Stripped of her throne but not her will, she fled with her Inner Court into exile. In Coffin Canyon, she has found not refuge, but opportunity. Here, she consecrates land, enslaves monsters, and grinds manlings beneath the weight of returning dominion.",
    "philosophy": "Order is not negotiated. It is imposed. Monsters are tools, humans are cattle, and land exists to be ruled. The Regent Black does not conquer for wealth — she conquers to restore hierarchy, with herself at its apex.",
    "history": "The fall of Monstru shattered the Crow Court, but it did not destroy it. Loyal servants followed the Queen into exile, carrying relics, rituals, and ancient knowledge of dominion. Coffin Canyon is not a refuge — it is a staging ground. Every battle fought here is another stone laid in the foundation of her returning empire."
