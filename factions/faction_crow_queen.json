    "description": "Once the absolute ruler of Monstru, the Crow Queen — now called the Regent Black — was deposed by the monster uprising. Stripped of her throne but not her will, she fled with her Inner Court into oblivion... until she discovered Coffin Canyon. Here, she seeks to claim a new realm, consecrating land, enslaving monsters, and erasing manlings from the soil she deems hers.",
    "philosophy": "Order is not negotiated. It is imposed. Monsters are tools, humans are cattle, and land exists to be ruled. The Regent Black does not conquer for wealth—she conquers to restore the natural hierarchy, with herself at its apex.",
    "history": "The fall of Monstru shattered the Crow Court, but it did not destroy it. Loyal servants followed the Queen into exile, carrying relics, rituals, and ancient knowledge of dominion. Coffin Canyon is not a refuge—it is a staging ground. Every battle fought here is another stone laid in the foundation of her returning empire."
