Coffin Canyon: Rules Master V9 (The Complete Source)
1. Engine Metadata & Core Philosophy

Philosophy: The 'Flavor Vault'. High-level tenets and the 'Fast Resolution' handshake. Everything in Coffin Canyon flows from a single value: Quality. It represents training, toughness, nerve, and luck. When Quality drops, everything becomes harder.

Balance Engine: Active.

Base Weights: Quality (Q) = 20 pts/die | Defense (D) = 10 pts | Move (M) = 6" Baseline (±5 pts per 1").

Rounding Rule: Final unit costs always round UP to the nearest 5 points.

2. Core Mechanics

Quality Definition

Value	Description	Internal Math (Base)
1	Basic trained human / small monster / civilian	20 pts
2	Veteran military unit / human sized monster	40 pts
3	Elite unit / large monster / hard to kill beast	60 pts
4	Leader unit / low hero / big or powerful monster	80 pts
5	High hero / very large or mystically powerful monster	100 pts
6	Epic supernatural kaiju, titan, or mechanical unit	120 pts
The Roll & Defense

The Roll: Roll d6s equal to current Quality. Success on 4+.

Defense & Damage: Passive value for positioning/armor. If Successes > Defense, the attack hits. Each success beyond Defense deals 1 damage.

Exceptions: Defense never applies to Terrain damage, Automatic damage, or Environmental effects.

Six-Based Effects

The Golden Rule: A single roll may only resolve ONE six-based bonus.

Natural Six: If the attack hits, deal at least 1 damage, even if Successes ≤ Defense.

Lucky Break: Triggered when all dice are 6s. Options: Quick Step (Free Half Move), Shake It Off (Remove 1 Pin/Condition), Deadeye (+1 die to next roll), Get It Done (Free Interact action).

3. Locomotion & Visibility

Visibility Vault

Line of Sight (LoS): A clear, believable line between attacker and target. If in doubt, LoS is blocked.

Blockers: Solid walls, Cliff faces, Large rocks, Intact buildings.

Non-Blockers: Fences, Railings, Windows, Rubble, Boardwalks, Light vegetation.

Cover: Partial obstruction. Grants +1 Defense vs ranged. Negated if attacker is in the same terrain piece or target is in Burning terrain.

Locomotion Vault

Movement: Measure in inches from base. Movement may be split by other actions.

Difficult Terrain: Rubble, Steep slopes, Deep mud. Movement is halved (round down).

Impassable: Solid cliffs, Deep chasms. Cannot enter.

Engagement: Engaged when in melee range. Melee Pressure: While engaged, suffer -1 die on Ranged attacks and cannot gain Cover.

This file is now ready to be saved as your V9 Rules Master. It is a perfect blend of your flavor-text and a robust, scalable math engine.

Would you like me to create a "Stress Test" calculation for a specific unit (like a Yokai Ranger or a Brine Diver) to show you exactly how the app will pull from this file?
