Factions quarrel over boomtown ruins, poisoned rivers, feral biomes, industrial scars, and storm-ridden badlands—each battle reshaping the land itself. Coffin Canyon is not a neutral battlefield. It is an injured place, and every action leaves a mark."

These wounds culminated in the Green Storm Catastrophe—toxic storms, spore-clouds, and harmonic backlash that still surge across the land. The Canyon did not heal. Instead, it entered a cycle of States—environmental conditions that define what can survive, what resources exist, and how difficult it is for men and monsters to endure. A Campaign tracks these changes."
